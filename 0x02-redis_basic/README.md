## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to use Redis for basic operations.
- Learn how to use Redis as a simple cache.

## Requirements
- All code is interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- Code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Documentation is required for all modules, classes, functions, and methods.
- Redis must be installed on the system.
- Redis Python client must be installed using pip.
- Redis server should be started with the following command:


## Tasks Overview
1. **Writing strings to Redis**
   - Create a Cache class to store data in Redis using a randomly generated key.
   
2. **Reading from Redis and recovering original type**
   - Create a method to retrieve data from Redis and optionally convert it back to its original type.
   
3. **Incrementing values**
   - Implement a system to count how many times methods of the Cache class are called.
   
4. **Storing lists**
   - Define a decorator to store the history of inputs and outputs for a particular function.
   
5. **Retrieving lists**
   - Implement a function to display the history of calls of a particular function.
   
6. **Implementing an expiring web cache and tracker (Advanced)**
   - Implement a function to obtain the HTML content of a URL, track the number of times the URL is accessed, and cache the result with an expiration time.
